I looked around for some point to telescope tutorials that I liked but couldnt find anything that really suited my needs so I made a frankenstein of code that works well together.

Eventually I'd like to make this a motor mounted go to telescope but ill have some things to work out before doing that, specifically getting a telescope that will work with it.  But this is great for going out and doing some quick ameture astronomy.  Astrobeano also added a camera functionality that i like and havent played with yet.  I plan on using soemthing like this to help with that, http://www.circuitspecialists.com/bpi-d1-camera-board.html,  With that i'd be able to nix the banana pi completley, and save a ton of space.


It uses astropy from http://www.astropy.org/ for things like calculating Greenwich sidereal time, so you need to install that too.

also the official blog for this project is http://andrewsastroblog.blogspot.com/

Have fun! If you have any questions let me know and ill address them.
